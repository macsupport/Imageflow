\f0\fs24 \cf0 A brand new version of ImageFlow, Version 4! \
This version is been completely rewritten and now utilizes Yossi Kiolesnicov's  jQuery LightBox, YoxView integrated into Sebastion Kutsch's ContentFlow script. New features include an integrated FooterBar containing the navigation menu, Social Media links, and options for a user configured About Page as well as an Ajax powered Contact page.  A Web based HTML editor is included to incorporate your own information into the About page. The Lightbox now only opens when the center image is clicked, and the movement of the Lightbox image previous and next buttons are linked to the previous and next movement of the ImageFlow. The Lightbox has integrated buttons for Print and Download and EXIF info can be included as well. Gallery page colors are user configurable as well as an option for any image to be used as a page background. It has been tested in Internet Explorer 7 and 8 ( IE 6 is not supported - time for those users to upgrade after 10 years!), FireFox, Safari for Mac and Windows. Since this is a new version I appreciate and bug reports! ( I am primarily a Mac user so any IE issues found will really help me!)}
